      <h1 class="font-bold text-black text-xl">Question-1: What is DOM? What is the purpose of the DOM?</h1>
      <p class="text-justify mx-2  mt-2">
        An XML and HTML document's programming interface is called the Document Object Model (DOM). Each element,
        attribute, and line of text in the document is represented by a corresponding object in the DOM tree, which
        depicts the web page as an organized tree of objects. Programming languages like JavaScript may access and
        modify the information and structure of a web page via the DOM. <br />
        The major goal of the DOM is to give web developers a common programming interface for accessing and modifying a
        web page's content and structure. Developers can dynamically change a web page's content, add new material, or
        react to user actions like clicks and keypresses by utilizing the DOM. JavaScript code, for instance, can be
        used to modify the style of existing components, add new items to the page, or react to user input. Ultimately,
        the DOM is essential to web development because it makes it possible to create dynamic, interactive web pages
        that can react to user input and offer a rich user experience.

      <h1 class="font-bold text-black text-xl">Question-2: How many ways do you select event from DOM?</h1>
      <p class="text-justify mx-2 mt-2">
        There are several ways to select events from the DOM in JavaScript: <br />
        <span class="underline font-bold">addEventListener() method:</span> The most popular approach for tying event
        listeners to DOM components is this one. I will define the kind of event you want to listen for as well as the
        action to take when the event takes place.
        <br />
        <span class="underline font-bold">'onclick()' attribute:</span> In order to use this technique, an HTML element
        must have a onclick property that is assigned to a JavaScript function that will be called whenever the element
        is clicked. <br />
        <span class="underline font-bold">onload attribute:</span> After a web page has finished loading, the window
        object's load event is triggered, and this attribute enables you to add an event listener to that event. <br />
        <span class="underline font-bold">onsubmit attribute:</span> With the use of this property, you may connect an
        event listener to a form element's submit event. <br />
        <span class="underline font-bold">onchange attribute:</span> The change event of an input element, which is
        triggered when the value of the input is modified, can have an event listener attached to it thanks to this
        property.

      <h1 class="font-bold text-black text-xl">Question-3: What is eventBubble?</h1>
      <p class="text-justify mx-2 mt-2">
        An event that is triggered on a nested element will "bubble up" and trigger any event listeners linked to its
        parent elements all the way up to the document root thanks to a technique known as event bubbling in the DOM
        (Document Object Model). <br />
        Let's say, for instance, that I have a button element nested inside a div element. A click event will be fired
        on the button if I click it. Nevertheless, due to event bubbling, the div> element that contains the button as
        well as any parent elements of the div> element, all the way up to the document root, will also be affected by
        the click event. <br />
        When handling events on several items with a single event listener, this can be helpful, but if I'm not
        cautious, it could potentially have unwanted effects. I can use your event listener function to execute the
        stopPropagation() method on the event object to stop event bubbling. This will stop the event from moving up the
        DOM tree further.

        Question-4: What is callback function? What does callback function do?
      </h1>
      <p class="text-justify mx-2 mt-2">
        A callback function in JavaScript is a function that is performed after another function has finished doing its
        work. It is supplied as an argument to the other function. The callback function must be called at the proper
        moment by the function that receives it as an argument. <br />
        When a function must wait for an activity to finish (such an HTTP request or a file system operation) before it
        can continue running, callbacks are frequently employed in asynchronous programming. When an operation is
        finished, the callback function is used to manage the results.
